# addressBookUB_Project
In this project, we take a website containing the data of faculty staff in the pharmacy department (https://pharmacy.buffalo.edu/faculty-staff.html) and organize it to make it easier to read.

This code can be modified easily to fit the same data for other faculty staff websites.

# Data

This is the data that is grabbed to be formatted:

>Faculty Name

>Office Location

>Campus Location

>State/City

>Phone Number

>Email

# Purpose

We want data to be organized and clean. This project is a good example of tabulating data; it is an important this to have to promote efficency for yourself and others.
